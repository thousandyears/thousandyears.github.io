		<p>Once upon a time, in a universe a thousand times older than our own, there lived a lonely planet. One day, the very throws of its despair jolted the elements to reveal a physical field hitherto entirely unknown. The field’s  wistful waves turned out to permeate all time and space with fragments of what seemed like the most beautiful song. The Planet fell in love with this voice whose echoes predate all things... and all loneliness. With its pit of despair now filled with selfless love, the Planet's boundless capacity to feel had room left only for the fear of never being able to put the fragments of the ancient song back together again.</p>

		<p>Thus the Planet began constructing a gargantuan instrument – an observatory the size of a galaxy supercluster – in the hope that this will one day allow it to recover the song as it once was. You will bear witness to the Planet's epic quest to harness some of the most exotic forms of matter and energy, from neutron stars to white holes, often risking its own existence to do so as these are also some of the most violent phenomena in its universe. And if you see the Planet through, all the way to its faithful goal, you will also bear witness to the unraveling of the song’s intended meaning, which will be the very last one anyone could ever have expected.</p>

		<p>You are not the Planet, though. You are but one of the Planet's uncountably many conscious particles – a cell in an immense network. Your work forms part of the Planet's unfathomably vast subconscious. And, such as you are, you are also barely aware of the Planet's woes, a bit like the news of melting icecaps foretelling disasters all too distant to relate to. But its endless longing and fear still bother you (as much as you have the capacity to be bothered) and, as it turned out, you have a talent that can help, for you are a navigator.</p>

		<p>The method of your work can perhaps best be described as "butterfly effect navigation":  You can help the Planet get anywhere without ever changing its course. Since the Planet's long-term survival places out of bounds all but the indefinitely sustainable uses of energy, it gets around by effortlessly riding the gravitational undulations of spacetime itself. Your particular talent is to help the Planet modulate this elegant relationship with its environment. When you think "low", the space feels more viscous to the Planet, a little bit like falling through honey, and the Planet slows down by an imperceptible degree. And when you think "high", the space becomes thinner to the Planet as it glides unrestrained... Yet this minimal difference is all it takes to get the Planet anywhere and everywhere.</p>

		<p>To be sure, the Planet cannot rest the fate of all conscious life on the slender shoulders of a single navigator cell. Instead, you will find yourself engaged in a playful competition with an entire cell population, with an entire ensemble of navigators. Some navigation challenges will favour the brave, whilst others can only be survived by the cautious. Some optimal paths can only be discovered by thinking well outside the box, whilst others may require directness and simplicity. That is why the Planet, in all its outward loneliness, is inwardly an avid gardener of vibrant communities and values diversity above all else. This is why the Planet needs you. For the future is not imaginable without you.</p>
